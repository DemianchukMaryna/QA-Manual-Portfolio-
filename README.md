# QA-Manual-Portfolio-
**I am a dedicated and passionate individual with a
strong background in teaching foreign languages,
and I would like to start a new career in QA
Manual Testing. Over the years, my work as a
teacher has sharpened my attention to detail,
problem-solving skills, and ability to communicate
complex concepts effectively. These qualities,
combined with my desire for continuous learning,
have driven me to pursue a career in Quality
Assurance.**
